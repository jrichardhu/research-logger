# Quantitative Research Workflow Guide

## Introduction

This guide outlines a comprehensive workflow for conducting and documenting quantitative research, combining traditional paper notes with a digital logging system. The system is designed to support the natural flow of research while ensuring no valuable insights or ideas are lost. Think of it as your research companion that helps maintain the rigor of academic documentation while preserving the creativity and flexibility needed for innovative research.

## System Setup

### Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have the necessary tools installed:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install rich pandas numpy

# Run the research logger
python research_logger.py
```

The system uses the `rich` library for better console formatting, making it easier to read and interact with your research log throughout the day.

### Initial Configuration

When first running the logger, you'll be prompted to configure your research environment:

```bash
Enter project name: AdaptiveVolatility
Enter base path for research files (default: ./research): 
```

The project name should reflect your research area, and the base path determines where your research artifacts will be stored. The system will automatically create a structured directory system to organize your work.

## Directory Structure

Understanding the directory structure helps you navigate your research artifacts:

```
research/
├── experiments/          # Experimental results and data
│   └── experiment_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
│       ├── metadata.json    # Experiment configuration
│       ├── results.json     # Complete results and conclusions
│       └── figures/         # Generated visualizations
├── ideas/                # Research ideas and their evolution
│   └── idea_summaries.json
├── daily_logs/          # Daily research activities
│   └── daily_YYYYMMDD.json
├── paper_notes/         # References to physical notebook entries
│   └── note_references.json
├── figures/             # Shared visualizations
├── data/                # Research datasets
├── models/              # Implemented algorithms
└── backups/             # Automated backups
    └── backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

## Paper Notes System

Your physical research notebook serves as the primary tool for developing ideas and working through problems. To integrate it effectively with the digital system:

### Notebook Structure
- Use bound notebooks with pre-numbered pages
- Date every page
- Reserve first 5 pages for table of contents
- Mark notes with category symbols:
  - [H] Hypothesis or theoretical foundation
  - [E] Experiment design or methodology
  - [Q] Questions or uncertainties to investigate
  - [R] Results and observations
  - [I] Important insights or realizations

### Note Taking Best Practices
- Write the category symbol at the top of each entry
- Include page references to related notes
- Mark transferred notes with a checkmark (✓)
- Draw clear boxes around key equations or algorithms
- Note any GitHub commits or experimental results related to the notes

## Daily Workflow

The research logger provides ten core functions to support your daily research activities:

### 1. Start Day (Option 1)
Begin each day by setting clear objectives:
```python
> Enter daily goals (empty line to finish):
> Implement adaptive volatility estimation
> Review recent backtesting results
> Document theoretical foundations
```

### 2. Review Daily Goals (Option 2)
Review current goals:
- Update progress of individual goals
- View goal summary
- Check status of unfinished goals

### 3. Add Research Idea (Option 3)
Capture new research directions:
```python
> Enter idea title: Regime-Aware Volatility
> Enter description: Adjust estimation window based on market regime
```

### 4. Add Insight (Option 7)
Record important realizations:
```python
> Enter observation: Volatility clustering affects window size
> Enter implications: Need to consider market regimes
```

### 5. Add Paper Note (Option 2)
Transfer important notes from your notebook:
```python
> Enter notebook ID: NB2025-1
> Enter page number: 42
> Enter note type (H/E/R/I/Q): H
> Enter summary: Derivation of adaptive estimation window
```

### 6. Start Experiment (Option 6)
Document new research experiments:
```python
> Enter experiment hypothesis: Adaptive window improves accuracy
> Enter methodology: Compare fixed vs adaptive windows
> Enter parameters (empty line to finish):
> window_size: 60
> adaptation_rate: 0.1
```

### 7. Generate Weekly Digest (Option 5)
Create a summary of research progress:
- Active experiments and their status
- Ideas in development
- Recent insights and findings

### 8. Check Stale Ideas (Option 4)
Review and update older research threads:
```python
> Enter days threshold (default 30): 14
```

### 9. Conclude Experiment (Option 8)
Document experimental outcomes:
```python
> Enter conclusions: Adaptive window reduces estimation error
> Enter next steps: Implement in production system
```

### 10. Create Backup (Option 9)
Safeguard your research progress:
```python
> Enter backup path (optional): /backup/research
```

## Research Session Structure

# During analysis
log.add_insight(
    observation="Significant regime change detected",
    implications="Need to adjust estimation window"
)
```

### Version Control Integration

Link your research log with git:
```python
# Experiment is automatically linked to current git commit
experiment = log.start_experiment(
    hypothesis="New volatility estimator",
    methodology="Compare with benchmark"
)
```
